gidgethub --- An async library for calling GitHub's API
=======================================================

While there are many
`GitHub libraries <https://developer.github.com/libraries/>`_ for
Python, when this library was created there were none oriented towards
async usage. On top of that, there were also no libraries which took
a `sans-I/O approach <https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/>`_ to their
design. Because of that, this project was created.

About the title
---------------
With there being so many pre-existing GitHub libraries, it was tough
to come up with a new name. So in the end I just named it after my
cat. ðŸ˜Š

"Gidget" sounds somewhat like an elongated version of "git"
so that made some sense phoenetically. And with the
`octocat <https://octodex.github.com/>`_ being the mascot of GitHub,
it seemed fitting to have the name be somewhat feline-related.
